# Simple producer/consumer AQMP application 

This app is a profe of concept for the creation of queues and exchanges using the AMQPAdmin class. Currently other projects define there AMQP enties using the RabbitMQ Management plugin. The deployment is not optimal, because exchanges, queues and bindings have to be manualy managed.
